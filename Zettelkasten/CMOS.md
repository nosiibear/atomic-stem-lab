Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) refers to two things, primarily:
- A type of [[MOSFET]] configuration that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of MOSFETs- one n-channel MOSFET and one p-channel MOSFET.
- The methods of implementing this type of design on integrated circuits.

Because of this combination, they only draw power on the transition between states. This, among other things, makes them a popular choice for creating [[Integrated circuit]]s, where even a small increase in power draw per transistor would result in an enormous power draw across the integrated circut when using up to billions of transistors per integrated circuit.
