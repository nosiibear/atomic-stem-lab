An electric circuit is a specific type of electrical network which can either be:
- An interconnection of electric or [[Electronic component]]s which form a closed loop, creating a return path for the current, and enabling an electrical flow. 
- An theoretical model of an interconnection of [[Electrical element]]s which also form a closed loop.

In an electric circuit, the electrical components and connecting wire must form a closed loop, where an electrical network refers to all arrangements of components and wire which don't necessarily form closed loops.
