A liquid crystal display is a type of display which uses an array of [[Liquid crystal]]s to block light from a backlight on a granular, per-pixel level, resulting in an image.

Here are the layers that usually comprise an LCD:
- Liquid crystal layer
- Sandwiched by two molecule thick transparent electrodes, usually [[Indium tin oxide]]
- Sandwiched by two polarizing filters, one parallel and one perpindicular
