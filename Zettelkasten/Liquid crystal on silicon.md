A liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS or LCOS) display is a miniature [[Active-matrix LCD]] placed on a silicon backpane.

The layers of an LcOS typically include:
- [[Indium tin oxide]] layer
- Liquid crystal layer
- Silicon backpane
    - Array of [[CMOS]] transistors? Single CMOS transistor?
    - Square reflective aluminum electrodes arranged in a grid, each controlling one pixel
