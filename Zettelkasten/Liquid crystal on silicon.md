A liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS or LCOS) display is a miniature [[Active-matrix LCD]] placed on a silicon backpane.

The layers of an LCOS typically include:
- [[Indium tin oxide]] layer
- Liquid crystal layer
- Square reflective aluminum electrodes arranged in a grid
- Silicon backplane
    - Array of [[CMOS]] transistors? Single CMOS transistor? each controlling one pixel

Basically, a beam of light is directed at the front of the LCOS display, which passes through the liquid crystal layer, reflects off the aluminum layer, and bounces back through the LC layer, out of the device. A CMOS in the silicon backplane actually determines the brightness of each pixel-sized group of liquid crystals by running an electric current through the aluminum layer, through a pixel-sized group of liquid crystals, to a matching ITO on the device's surface, un-twisting the crystals' helical arrangement, resulting in the cross-polarized setup cancelling out all light passing through at the pixel level.
