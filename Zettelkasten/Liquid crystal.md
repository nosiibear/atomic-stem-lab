A liquid crystal is a material which can exist in a state of matter between solid and liquid broadly called mesophase. The molecules in a liquid crystal structure can be oriented in a number of ways, resulting in different mesophases.

Broadly, there are two types of liquid crystals:
- Thermotropic: Obtained by melting a crystalline solid, where primarily temperature and secondarily pressure controls the phase of the liquid crystal.
- Lyotropic: Where liquid crystalline behavior is found in certain colloidal solutions and certain polymers.

Liquid crystals have either partial or completely absent positional order, but have specific orientational order, where variation mainly in orientational order (still along with positional order) define different phases.
In thermotropic liquid crystals, an increase in temperature drives change between two umbrella categories of phase between solid and liquid. Here are the phases, actually ordered by transition from liquid to solid in decreasing temperature (ordered this way as a better progressive disclosure)
- Isotropic phase: Uniformly random crystal orientation at higher temperature.
- Anisotropic phases: Non-uniformity of orientation, many sub-phases of structure at lower temperatures.
    - Nematic phase: M, on average, parallel to a common direction- a unit vector n, called the "director", the simplest of phases
    - Smectic phase: Molecules are oriented parallel to a common direction, and are stacked in layers, most common phase
    - Cholesteric, chiral, chiral smectic or twisted nematic phase: Molecules are stacked in layers like smectic phase, orientation varies between layers and forms a helical structure

Thermotropic liquid crystals also tend to respond very strongly and reliably to electric fields, making them useful in [[Liquid crystal display]] and [[Liquid crystal on silicon]] technology. This happens when the liquid crystals have a natural or induced dipole moment.
