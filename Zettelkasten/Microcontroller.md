A microcontroller is a small [[Computer]] implemented on a single [[Integrated circuit]]. Microcontrollers contain one ore more CPUs, memory, and programmable I/O peripherals like [[General-purpose input output]] pins.

A microcontroller is similar to a [[System on a Chip]], but differs in a few ways. Microcontrollers are often suited for singular, real-time tasks which require less processing power or peripheral input/output. They have lower software complexity than SoCs, and usually don't feature an operating system, either.
