A semiconductor is a material with electrically conductive properties; it's not as insulative as an insulator, and it isn't as conductive as a material like copper, silver, or aluminum.

The semiconductor's efficiency, as well as other behavioral properties, can be manipulated by the use of [[Doping]], which introduces calculated impurities into the structure's crystal lattice, resulting in improved efficiency.
