A thin-film transistor is a special type of [[Field-effect transistor]] where a transistor is deposited in layers on an inert substrate, like glass.

The components that usually comprise a thin-film transistor are:
- Substrate
- Dielectric
- [[Semiconductor]]
- Source, drain and gate electrodes, which sometimes use [[Indium tin oxide]] because it's transparent
