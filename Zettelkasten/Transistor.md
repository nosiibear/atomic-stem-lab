A transistor is a type of [[Semiconductor device]] which acts as an amplifier or a switch for other electronics. A voltage or current applied to one of the transistor's terminals controls the amount of current passing through the other two terminals, where the amount of current allowed to pass can be much greater than the current required to operate the transistor.
