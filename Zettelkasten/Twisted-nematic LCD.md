A twisted-nematic LCD is a type of [[Liquid crystal display]] that uses [[Liquid crystal]]s set in the twisted nematic phase.

When no voltage is supplied to the liquid crystals, the twisted nematic phase alignment of the liquid crystals allows light to come in through a polarizer, then circularly rotate 90 degrees along the crystal structure until it passes through a perpindicularly angled second polarizer, bypassing the complete filtering of light which would have resulted from the opposingly angled polarizers.

When voltage is applied to the liquid crystals, the crystals completely lose their phase structure, resulting in no optical rotation, meaning the crossed polarizers completely block incoming and outgoing light.
